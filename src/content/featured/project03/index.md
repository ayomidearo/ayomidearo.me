FemmeBNB is a platform in which women can connect with other women. This platform serves as an online place where women could potentially find other women with similar travel interests, around the world or in their communities. They could discuss previous travels, provide travel tips, and help each other when planning a new trip. It also provides a list of spaces in which female travelers would feel comfortable and safe.
