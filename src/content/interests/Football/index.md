Football is one of my greatest love; I live for the weekends. There's nothing more beautiful than watching Arsenal trash incompetent teams in the premier league. I also showcase some of my football talents on the pitch sometimes. Not as fit as I used to though, probably explains why I broke my leg and my arm on two different occasions.
